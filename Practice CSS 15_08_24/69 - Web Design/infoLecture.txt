Combing Colors: 
 Scientific way : 
	picking color palate next to Each other Called 
	Analogous Colors , these looks harmonious and look good  together 
good for navigation bar & body of website / logo and its background 
but these doesn't pop out 
complementary Colors :
for design to pop out we need complementary Colors :
color plate that are opposite spectrum of each other 
Don't try complementary colors on text , its looks jarring / fuzzy

make sure color is consistent and convey the message. 

Typography / Font:
    Fonts also matter for right mood and message \
    Serif is inspired marvel carving .
    looks more serious, authoratative , old traditional ,Stable etc 

    san-serif is diferent family  it convays frendly highly readable
    sticking at most 2 fonts at one design 
        sticking to similar mood
        match time era. 
        have opposite serif ness 
        ALSO you can change the weight to make it interesting
