fixed sizing : 1rem or 2rem is relative to root size which is not responsive.
    grid-template-row: 100px 200px;
    grid-template-column: 400px 800px;
    can also bw written as : row / column;
            grid-template: 100px 200px / 400px 800px;
    
    another kinda responsive way is using auto but it behave differently 
    on row and column
        grid-template-row: 100px auto;
            first div will 100px height, but 2nd div will take content fit height.
        grid-template-column: 200px auto;
            first div will take 100px width but 2nd div will take all available width left;

test practice code: 
/* Write your CSS code below to make the purple items size, grow and shrink like the green ones.*/

.grid-container {
 display:grid;
 grid-template:repeat(2,1fr) 2fr / auto 400px minmax(200px,500px);
 grid-auto-rows:50px;
}
