flexbox sizing works by looking at priority of an element
    content width < width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width
    -------------> -------> ---------->  --------->
    *if flex-basis is smaller then max-width then flexbox will respect felx-basis 
    but if flex-besis is larger then max width will implimented until it can 

    *mix-width: determines the growth potential
    *min-width: determines shrink potential

    min-width: looks at longest possible word
    max-width: looks at max possible line

    flex-grow/flex-shrink: potential can eneble that priority to grow or shrink 1=yes ,0=no

flex: 1 1 0 = gorw-on shrink-on flex-basis=auto;
