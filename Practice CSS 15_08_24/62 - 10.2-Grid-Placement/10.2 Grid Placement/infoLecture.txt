Grid Placement:
    Container: contain all the items
    grid tracks: create row and column and these are collectively known as tracks, row traks /column cracks. 
    grid cells: intersection of these Tracks known as cell.can create grid items using multiple cells. 
    grid lines: control this line using grid gap, these ceperate our tracks

by default a grid will contain as much as vertical space as content .

 now lets see an example:
    <div cleass="container">
        <div cleass="item Cowboy"> </div >  
        <div cleass="item astronaut"> </div >  
        <div cleass="item book"> </div >  
    </div >  

    CSS:
    .container{
        height:100vh;
        display:grid;
        grid-template-column: 1fr 1fr 1.5fr;
        grid-template-row: 1fr 1fr;
        gap:3rem; will make the gap bigger,

    }
