Float Property: wrap around text on perticula element
    example: 
        img{
            float:left / float: right 
        }
    will make perticular image float left / right and text associated with it will
    wrap around the image.

    for some element we dont want thouse to wrap around so we use clear Property
    example:
        footer{
            clear: left/right   clear respective float CSS Property
        }
    
    if both have as float like one Property as float right and another float left then we 
    can make 
    clear : both;
