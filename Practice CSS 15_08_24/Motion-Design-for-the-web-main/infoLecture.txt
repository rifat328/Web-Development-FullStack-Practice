CSS Transition is not CSS animation ,
     its only do the change between one state to another 
     nothing in between. like an arrow initial to target \

applying transition in css is done by using 
Transition Property, transition duration,transition timing function,
transition-delay

in short it can be written as :
     transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay
                    color                   400ms or 0.4s           ease-in-out         1s
    

you can add multiple transition by using , between them 

transition : all       will do the transition for all but it must be avoided to resolve performence eror.
